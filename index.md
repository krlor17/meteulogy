title: Meteulogy
---

Meteulogy is a hobby blog on dynamic meteorology -- and probably loosely related topics -- made to document my learning trip in lieu of a curriculum and exams.
The name is, of course, a dumb play on words mashing together _meteorology_ and _eulogy_ into a portmanteau that might just resemble a drunken pronounciation of the primary subject.
A halfhearted justification will point to the etymology of _eu_-_logy_ deriving from classical greek _eu_ ("well" or "true") and _logia_ ("words" or "text") -- I will of course endeavor to write truthful and (hopefully) well-composed texts.
The only thing I aim to kill in the process, however, is a little spare time.
